Rubric
1. Write a program that gathers input data from a text box control.
Convert Button:

* When clicked, input is parsed into double value and asssigned to lbs variable.
* The mathematical result from dividing lbs by massValue is assigned to kg.
* kg variable is casted into a string with one numerical value after the decimal and assigned to displayWeightTextBox.Text.
* Button declared as accept button.
2. Declare and initialize primitive variables and select appropriate variable types for a computational problem.

* lbs is declared as a double value and initialized with the value of double.Parse(weightTextBox.Text) or input.
* kg is declared as a double value and initialized as the result from dividing lbs by massValue.
* massValue is initialized with the rounded conversion mass value of 2.2.
3. Formulate mathematical expressions to solve problems.

* Mathematical expression is the division of lbs by massValue.
4. Use the .NET environment to develop a simple graphical user interface using built-in tools.

* Clicking the Convert button converts the input in lbs to kg.
